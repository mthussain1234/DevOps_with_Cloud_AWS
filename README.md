# Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a form of technology that allows for people to access resouces such as storage, processing power(computing power) and apps.
You can use these resources from a distant location, generally accessing a **server**, usually found in something called a **data center**.
A data center is a facility which houses IT infrastructure to build run and deliver apps, it is also used to store data related to 
these apps and services. These data centers are usually managed by a cloud provider.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing?

* Cost-effective CapEx:
  * Help businesses save money on capital expenditures
    * Cloud Computing allows for businesses to avoid upfront costs
    * Businesses pay for infrastructure on a subscription basis
      * More effective in the Long Run
      
* Responsibility of firewall security
  * This responsibility is shared between the cloud provider and user
    * Provider will be securing the hardware and infrastructure
    * User will be securing their own applications and data
     * This shared responsibility can help manage security risks

* Ease of Use
  * Cloud computing is user friendly and easy to use
  * Providers will give wide range of tools and serviecs accessible to all skill levels
  * Allows for businesses to get up and running with cloud computing efficiently

* Scalability
  * Cloud computing allows for businesses to scale up easily and quickly by simple upgrading their subscription
    * New subscriptions can mean increasing or decreasing computing resources when needed
  * As opposed to on site, where scaling up is a costly process as expensive hardware is invested in.
  * Working with the cloud is good for businesses where their needs are constantly changing.

Cloud computing is used for many things, from running web apps and storing data, to automating business processes.
A lot of the reasons why we should use it ties in with the benefits. 

Cloud computing allows businesses to be more flexible, the ability to scale resources up and down lets you meet demands without the need to put in a lot of money for actual physical infrastructure. This ties in with the capital expenditure for the business, where on site hardware would simply cost more than using hardware on the cloud.

### How does it fit into DevOps?
