# Cloud Computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a form of technology that allows for people to access resouces such as storage, processing power(computing power) and apps.
You can use these resources from a distant location, generally accessing a **server**, usually found in something called a **data center**.
A data center is a facility which houses IT infrastructure to build run and deliver apps, it is also used to store data related to 
these apps and services. These data centers are usually managed by a cloud provider.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing?

* Cost-effective CapEx:
  * Help businesses save money on capital expenditures
    * Cloud Computing allows for businesses to avoid upfront costs
    * Businesses pay for infrastructure on a subscription basis
      * More effective in the Long Run
      
* Responsibility of firewall security
  * This responsibility is shared between the cloud provider and user
    * Provider will be securing the hardware and infrastructure
    * User will be securing their own applications and data
     * This shared responsibility can help manage security risks

* Ease of Use
  * Cloud computing is user friendly and easy to use
  * Providers will give wide range of tools and serviecs accessible to all skill levels
  * Allows for businesses to get up and running with cloud computing efficiently

* Scalability
  * Cloud computing allows for businesses to scale up easily and quickly by simple upgrading their subscription
    * New subscriptions can mean increasing or decreasing computing resources when needed
  * As opposed to on site, where scaling up is a costly process as expensive hardware is invested in.
  * Working with the cloud is good for businesses where their needs are constantly changing.

### Why should we use Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is used for many things, from running web apps and storing data, to automating business processes.
A lot of the reasons why we should use it ties in with the benefits. 

Cloud computing allows businesses to be more flexible, the ability to scale resources up and down lets you meet demands without the need to put in a lot of money for actual physical infrastructure. This ties in with the capital expenditure for the business, where on site hardware would simply cost more than using hardware on the cloud.

### How does it fit into DevOps?

Cloud computing provides DevOps teams with scalability, flexibility and automation.

* Infrastructure as Code (IAC): instead of manually setting up servers, networks and other components, you can use code to define their own infrastructure requirements and automate this process of deploying and managing their infrastructure
* CI/CD (Continuous integration and delivery): cloud computing allows the CI/CD pipeline to be automated, which in turn allows for continuous testing, integration and deployment of code
* Scalability and Flexibility: The cloud platforms provided are scalable and flexible for deploying applications
* Collaboration: Working on the cloud allow for DevOps teams to be more collaborative by having centralized storage, shared access to resources

### How does it benefit the business?

* Combining with the benefits mentioned earlier, allows for businesses to be more **agile**
  * More flexible to changing needs, which will ultimately lead to faster time to market, and improved customer satisfaction
  * Cost effectiveness of cloud computing, heavily reduces capital expenditure when compared with onsite infrastructure, where investing into actual hardware is much more expensive
